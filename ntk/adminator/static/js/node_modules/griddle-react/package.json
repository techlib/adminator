It depends on [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).\r\n\r\nPlease check out the [documentation and examples](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle).\r\n\r\nTo use Griddle:\r\n\r\n`npm install griddle-react`\r\n\r\n***Or***\r\n\r\ndownload and reference griddle.js from the build directory (npm is preferred).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTo run from source, type the following commands into a terminal:\r\n\r\n1. `npm install -g grunt-cli` if you don't have grunt.\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. `grunt`\r\n4. That's it!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nGriddle is not yet version 1. There are likely some areas that will change and some issues that you may encounter. Please submit issues / pull requests for anything you run into.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n###Contributing:###\r\n\r\nPlease feel free submit any bugs or suggestions as issues. If you are having problems getting up and running please post in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/DynamicTyped/Griddle) and we'll try to help out. Pull requests are welcome but if you have an idea please post as an issue first to make sure everyone is on the same-page (and to help avoid duplicate work). If you are looking to help out but don't know where to start, please take a look at [approved issues that don't have anyone assigned](https://github.com/dynamictyped/griddle/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aapproved+no%3Aassignee).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n###Changelog:###\r\n\r\n0.2.13\r\n- Numerous bug fixes, additions.\r\n- Additional notes will be added soon.\r\n...\r\n\r\n0.2.1 - 0.2.3\r\n- Tweaks surrounding package.json dependencies.\r\n\r\n0.2.0\r\n\r\n1. __Styling__ - Griddle now renders as a single HTML table by default. Additionally, if you don't want to use Griddle's styles they can be turned off with a property `useGriddleStyles={false}`. [See more on styling](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/styling.html).\r\n1. __External Results__ - External data should now be passed in via props rather than a callback. The Griddle callback is still available for those that wish to use it but it's now in a separate module. [More on External Data](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html)\r\n1. __Custom Components__ - In addition to swapping out the column or row with a custom component, it's now possible to switch out the entire grid with a custom component. For example, the data could initially be rendered as a chart. The data that makes up the chart could be displayed by clicking on settings and unchecking the `Enable Custom Formatting` option. [Customization docs](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/customization.html#custom-grid-format)\r\n1. __Infinite Scrolling__ - Infinite scrolling can be toggled instead of the default pagination. [View infinite scrolling docs](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/infiniteScroll.html)  \r\n1. __New Documentation Site__ - The documentation site is a bit more thorough and no longer a single page. [Check it out here](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle)\r\n\r\n__Breaking Changes:__\r\n\r\n1. Updated the following properties:\r\n - **useCustomFormat** changed to **useCustomRowComponent**\r\n - **useCustomPager** changed to **useCustomPagerComponent**\r\n - **customFormat** changed to **customRowComponent**\r\n - **customPager** changed to **customPagerComponent**\r\n - **customFormatClassName** changed to **customRowComponentClassName**\r\n - **allowToggleCustom** to **enableToggleCustom**\r\n - **customNoData** changed to **customNoDataComponent**\r\n - *Significantly* changed **getExternalResults**. See the note below.\r\n2. The **getExternalResults** property and loading data from an external source has been updated quite a bit.\r\n - Rather than exposing a single method to load data, a series of 'external' properties are available to pass data to Griddle.\r\n - For those that wish to use a callback and to support implementations before v0.2.0 using **getExternalResults** method, the `GriddleWithCallback` component was created. For more on GriddleWithCallback, [view the documentation here.](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html#griddle-with-callback)\r\n - [Check out the entire external data documentation to read more.](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n0.1.19:\r\n\r\n1. Updated some of the documentation to note forthcoming changes to ExternalResults etc.\r\n2. Custom cell components now have a property  `rowData` as well as the `data`. [See here for more info](https://github.com/DynamicTyped/Griddle/issues/32)\r\n3. Components reference just `React` now instead of `React/Addons`.\r\n\r\n0.1.18:\r\n\r\n1. Fixed a bug where initialSort property wasn't getting used\r\n2. Added initialSortAscending prop (defaults to true)\r\n3. Removed references to bootstrap\r\n4. Fixed an issue with filtering and external results\r\n5. External Results fixes/enhancements\r\n6. Metadata enhancements\r\n",
